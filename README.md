# Description

This package can be used on its own but it is meant to be used by the other Gnome package to draw in widgets. However, if you want to use it standalone to make drawings saved in a file on disk, I would advice you to use the **Cairo** package of Timo.

# Documentation
## Release notes
* [Release notes][changes]

# Installation
As mentioned above, this package can be used on its own. But better install **Gnome::Gtk3** instead.

`zef install Gnome::Cairo`
